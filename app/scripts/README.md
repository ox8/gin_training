# What for this directory.
Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple (e.g., [`https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile)).

See the [`/scripts`](scripts/README.md) directory for examples.
